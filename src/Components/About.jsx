                <p><span className="intro">Hi, I'm Gabriel Wolf!</span> I'm a 24 year old American Colombian currently living with my cat Bakari in Medellin, Colombia. My work history includes titles such as professional hip hop dancer, Los Angeles real estate agent, and social media influencer. I was working mostly as a dancer until the pandemic in 2020. Since then I've been making my living online through social media platforms. The work I do doesn't require much time for me to be successful, so I started using my time trying many different business ideas. None caught my intrest more than web development. I really enjoy solving problems, creating pages, and implementing features because it makes me feel like i'm overcomming a challenge everytime I do.</p>
                <p>I've been working on my coding skills ever since! This very page was my creation and you will find more examples of my work if you read on. I'm very excited to get started working on more projects, so with this information I hope you'll consider me for a front-end developer position at your company.</p>
